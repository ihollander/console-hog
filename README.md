`console.log` is so passe. Install this package and you can `console.hog` instead!

```sh
npm install ihollander/console-hog
```

Then import it at the top level of your project:

```js
import 'console-hog'
```

## Disclaimer

This is definitely not a package meant to show you the dangers storing sensitive information in `localStorage`, don't worry ðŸ˜‰
